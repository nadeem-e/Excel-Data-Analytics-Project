Forme Essentials Annual Report 2022

Oct 2025 – Oct 2025

I recently completed a new milestone in my data analytics journey by creating an interactive annual report for my future brand Formé Essentials.

This project was built completely in Microsoft Excel, where I worked through the full data workflow — from data cleaning, data processing, and finally to data visualization.

The dataset used here is hypothetical(not real data), but it allowed me to explore key insights such as:
📊 Orders vs Sales trends
👕 Size distribution across categories
🧍‍♂️🧍‍♀️ Gender-based order analysis
🌍 Top performing states
📦 Channel-wise performance
